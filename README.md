## Story of Natilius

The idea for this project arose from the need to switch between multiple Mac OS devices as an engineer and data specialist. The final trigger was a switch after water damage. Natilius aims to simplify and expedite the process of setting up the development environment by taking care of all the small environmental aspects. It can be used in conjunction with [my mackup compatible dotfiles](https://github.com/koconder/dotfiles).

Natilius drew inspiration from the following Mac config/setup scripts:
