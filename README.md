üêö **Natilius** is a fully automated one-click mac developer enviroment script ‚ö°.

This script is designed to setup a mac from a fresh OS X install:

* Install various packages and apps required
* Stand-up development enviroments (Python, Java, Go, NodeJS)
* Sync and install dotfiles/preferences with [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup)
* Secure your mac _(based on my earlier work on [ostemper](https://github.com/koconder/ostemper))_

## Story of Natilius

This project was born after switching between many mac OS devices as an engineer and data specalist, the last switch was after water damage. This project aims to assist in the use of quickly having all the small enviromental ascepts taken-care of. This project is used in conjunction with [my mackup compatible dotfiles](https://github.com/koconder/dotfiles).
